## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nannipy/sapienza-foiling-team.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd sapienza-foiling-team
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create a local environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    *Note: You will need to populate `.env.local` with your Supabase project credentials. Refer to the Supabase documentation for details on setting up your project and obtaining these keys.*

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6.  **Open in browser:**
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

### Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server with Turbopack for faster compilation.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
-   `npm run start`: Starts the Next.js production server.
-   `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
-   `npm run test`: Runs all Jest tests.
-   `npm run test:watch`: Runs Jest tests in watch mode.
-   `npm run test:coverage`: Runs Jest tests and generates a coverage report.

## ☁️ Infrastructure

This project leverages the following infrastructure components:

-   **Supabase:**
    -   **Authentication:** Handles user sign-up, sign-in, and session management.
    -   **PostgreSQL Database:** Provides the relational database for storing application data (e.g., blog posts, user profiles).
    -   **Storage:** Used for managing and serving static assets like images (e.g., `public/hero.png`, `public/logosft.png`).
    -   **Edge Functions:** (If used) Serverless functions for custom backend logic.
    -   **Realtime:** (If used) For real-time data synchronization.
    -   **Local Development:** Configured via `supabase/config.toml` for local database and authentication emulation.

-   **Vercel:**
    -   **Deployment:** The primary platform for deploying the Next.js application to production.
    -   **Analytics:** Provides insights into website traffic and user behavior.
    -   **Speed Insights:** Helps monitor and improve website performance.

## 💻 Development Guide

### Component Structure
-   Use functional components with TypeScript.
-   Implement proper type definitions for props and state.
-   Follow the established folder structure within `app/components/`.
-   Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling.

### Styling Guidelines
-   Prefer Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
-   Adhere to the color scheme defined in `tailwind.config.js`.
-   Ensure responsive design principles are applied for various screen sizes.
-   Use custom color variables defined in `tailwind.config.js` for consistency.

### Adding New Features
1.  Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
2.  Implement the feature following our coding standards and best practices.
3.  Add necessary unit and integration tests for new functionality.
4.  Update relevant documentation (e.g., this README, inline comments).
5.  Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as the test runner and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react/) for testing React components.

-   **Configuration:** `jest.config.ts` and `jest.setup.ts` define the testing environment and setup.
-   **Test Files:** Tests are located in `app/__tests__/` and can also be placed alongside components (e.g., `ComponentName.test.tsx`).
-   **Running Tests:**
    -   `npm run test`: Executes all tests.
    -   `npm run test:watch`: Runs tests in interactive watch mode, re-running tests on file changes.
    -   `npm run test:coverage`: Generates a test coverage report, showing which parts of the code are covered by tests.
